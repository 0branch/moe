# Overview

moe adopts the mode and keybinding like vi/vim.
You can easily adapt if you have used vi/vim.
Currently you can use normal mode, visual mode, replace mode, insert mode, ex mode, filer mode.

# Install and compile

I recommend using nimble.
```
$ nimble install moe
```
If you want to compile or use a version in development.
```

```
